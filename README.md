## Background

This is a collection of 5 different content templates that I use in my teaching across 3 different programs that are based on the amazing $\LaTeX\,$ class, exam.cls.

- 0-GY11-QuizTemplate.tex
- 0-Gy11-TestTemplate.tex
- 0-IB-TestTemplate.tex
- 0-MYP-QuizTemplate.tex
- 0-MYP-TestTemplate.tex

I have tried to differentiate between content files and document structure files.
